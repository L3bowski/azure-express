# azure-express

Minimalist Node.JS express server template, ready to be uploaded to an Azure Web App. It uses Express 4 and includes a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and the config.json file from the repository.

After having many troubles to get an Express 4 server up and running in Azure, I followed [a this tutorial](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) in order to generate Azure compatible code.
