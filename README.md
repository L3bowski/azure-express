# azure-express

Minimalist Node.JS express server template, ready to be uploaded to an Azure Web App. It uses Express 4 and includes a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and the config.json file from the repository.

After having many troubles to get an Express 4 server up and running in Azure, I followed [this confusing tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started) in order to generate Azure compatible code. The only necessary setup to work with this code is to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed:

> git clone https://github.com/L3bowski/azure-express

> cd azure-express

> npm install

> npm start
